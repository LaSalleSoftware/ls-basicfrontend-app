Laravel Mix and [TailWind CSS Framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) are already set-up. 

So, the only thing that you have to do to get going is to this CLI command from the project root:

``` npm install ```

Then, it's the same `npm run dev` and `npm run production` as usual. 

Update:
- run `npm install @tailwindcss/ui`

Notes:
- I am using less.
